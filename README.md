## CSV to JSON converter
##### run in the terminal by:
```bash
node converter.js <existing_file_path> <new_file_path>
```

##### or by:
```bash
python converter.py <existing_file_path> <new_file_path>
```

###### The python converter has something wrong with it right now and for some reason certain rows have more items of data than there are headers. I might fix in the future but for now it just alerts the user of the number of rows this happens to.
